                <p>
                  Hey aahw, we gotta go to school</br>
                  Hey aahw, i know it'll not be cool</br>
                  Hey aahw, did you get the books?</br>
                  No? and so hope she doesn't look at us.</br>
                  Hey aahw, We're going to school</br>
                  Hey aahw, We woke up at 7 o'clock</br>
                  Hey aahw, for me this is a shock</br>
                  Then I go away to do my thing</br>
                  Now I'm going to see outside the house stranger things</br>
                  Hey i don't buy the eurospin</br>
                  Fax sprite clean rebel like bean</br>
                  This world is full of bad teens</br>
                  But then they always want to become queens</br></br>

                  This isn't rap, this isn't hip-hop, this is a psychopath's diary</br>
                  With panic attacks given by a sadistic brain</br>
                  I have a head injury but a doctor told me</br>
                  That a man with my pain is only better off if he dies</br>
                  I am aware that I am not Eminem</br>
                  And that if I didn't rap maybe now I'd be a virgin</br>
                  My mother doesn't understand my relationship with females</br>
                  Still defines me as a long-term abortion</br>
                  I blow, disappear like the leaves</br>
                  I suffer from my wounds but in disguise</br>
                  This is the end of my life,</br>
                  Killed by a knife</br>
                  Maybe of my wife</br>
