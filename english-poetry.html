              Hey aahw, we gotta go to school</br>
              Hey aahw, i know it'll not be cool</br>
              Hey aahw, did you get the books?</br>
              No? and so hope she doesn't look at us.</br>
              Hey aahw, We're going to school</br>
              Hey aahw, We woke up at 7 o'clock</br>
              Hey aahw, for me this is a shock</br>
              Then I go away to do my thing</br>
              Now I'm going to see outside the house stranger things</br>
              Hey i don't buy the eurospin</br>
              Fax sprite clean rebel like bean</br>
              This world is full of bad teens</br>
              But then they always want to become queens</br></br>

              This isn't rap, this isn't hip-hop, this is a psychopath's diary</br>
              With panic attacks given by a sadistic brain</br>
              I have a head injury but a doctor told me</br>
              That a man with my pain is only better off if he dies</br>
              I am aware that I am not Eminem</br>
              And that if I didn't rap maybe now I'd be a virgin</br>
              My mother doesn't understand my relationship with females</br>
              Still defines me as a long-term abortion</br>
              I blow, disappear like the leaves</br>
              I suffer from my wounds but in disguise</br>
              This is the end of my life,</br>
              Killed by a knife</br>
              Maybe of my wife</br>
